# Build Modern Next 14 Server Side App with Server Actions, Infinite Scroll & Framer Motion Animations

### What is Server Side architecture?

```

Modern websites use a well-known concept called — Infinite Scroll. It’s the natural pattern when the user consumes in the form of infinite posts. As we can’t just render 1 million posts, the information is delivered in chunks. Once the user finishes with a chunk, they scroll down to see the next piece (page). It’s used on many platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and etc.

```

### But how does it work?

```

The HTTP communication protocol helps establish the connection between the client and the server.
The client sends a request in the form of an XML or a JSON over the active connection. The client and server both understand the message format.
Upon receiving the client request, the server searches the requested data and sends back the relevant details as a response in the same format in which the request was received.
